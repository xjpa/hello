# Kind of like a bucket list I guess

- See Antarctica: the tours at gadventures.com look  good
 
- Study culinary arts: Florence Culinary Arts School in Italy looks great, or First Gourmet Academy in the Philippines

- Don't be a programmer all your life: Maybe go to law school? Or Medicine? Or culinary arts? Or be a scuba dive instructor? Just try exploring a career outside of being a software engineer once in my life.
