Some notes on my quick review of Racket before I start grinding the online course by Gregor Kiczales

<!-- more -->

```racket
(+ 2 3) ; output 5
(* 2 3) ; output 6
(* 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9) ; output 362880
(* 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0) ; output 0
```

In maths, this could work, but in Racket, this one wont work

```racket
(+ (2) (3))

;; output error message is the ff:
;
;application: not a procedure;
; expected a procedure that can be applied to arguments
;  given: 2
;  arguments...: [none]
```

This one is nested. As one could guess, it evaluates the expression inside the nested parenthesis first.

```racket
(+ 2 (* 3 3)) ; output 11
```

Arithmetics can also be done in string with Racket. Strings are those enclosed with double quotes. Note that I included spaces. <code>string-append</code> is an operation that adds strings, compared to just <code>+</code> with numbers.

```racket
(string-append "john" " patrick" " amata")
; outputs
; john patrick amata
```

<code>string-length</code> gets the number of characters of a string, this includes everything inside the double quotes, such as numbers and spaces.

```racket
(string-length "john patrick amata") ; output 18
(+ 3 (string-length "john patrick amata") ; output 21
```

we can convert a string to a number, here we convert  string "69" to a number

``` racket
(string->number "69") ; returns 69
(string->number "sixty nine") ; returns #f 
; #f is a boolean value that means false
; alternatively, we can use #false and #true as aliases for #f and #t
```

boolean algebra operations in racket. <code>string=?</code> returns if it's a string.

```racket
(and #true #true) ; output #t
(and #true #false) ; output #f
(or #true #false) ; output #t
(or #false #false) ; output #f
(not #false) ; output #t
(>= 10 10) ; output #t
(string=? "design" "tinker") ;output #f
(string=? "design") ;output #t
```

Lists in Racket, unlike things like numbers like 68 and strings like "sixty eight" and identifiers such as <code>pi</code>, are non-atomic data structures. 

Lists in Racket are a case of an <u>s-expression</u>, which basically when you visualise it are tree-like structures. To be more specific, they look like a binary tree.

Notice on the output the apostrophe <code>'</code>, which is an alias for the <code>quote</code> keyword


```racket
; list
(list 1 2 3) ; output '(1 2 3)
(list "a" "b" "caa") ; output '("a" "b" "caa")

; here's a list containing a list
(list 1 (list "a" "b") 2 3) ; output '(1 ("a" "b") 2 3)

; quote
; literal list, or a list created as is, can be made by using the keyword quote
(quote (1 "b" "c" 2 pi))
; the above prints '(1 "b" "c" 2 pi)
; in quoted lists, identifiers are printed as is.
; on non-quoted lists, identifiers are evaluated,
; like below is the un-quoted version of above, notice pi is evaluated
(list 1 "b" "c" 2 pi)
; the above prints '(1 "b" "c" 2 3.141592653589793)
; quote is used well in macros and s-expressions eval

; append
; the string-append version of a list
(append (list "a" "b" 1 2 3) (list "a" "c" 1 2 4))
; outputs
; '("a" "b" 1 2 3 "a" "c" 1 2 4)

; length
; gets the length of a list
(length (list "a" "b" 1 2 3)) ; output 5

; index-of
; returns the index of an item in the list
; if it doesnt find the item  in the list, it returns #f
(index-of (list 1 2 3 4 5) 4)
; outputs 3
; NOTE THAT IN RACKET: index starts with 0

; member
; checks if an item exists in a list, it returns #f if it doesnt find it
; but if it does find it, it'll return the first instance of it in the list 
; and the rest of the items of the list to the right of it
(member 3 (list 1 2 3 4 5))
; output
; '(3 4 5)

; reverse
; reverses a list
(reverse (list "a" "b" 1 2 3))
; outputs
; '(3 2 1 "b" "a")

; sort
; we use < and  > for the order
(sort (list 1 2 3 4 5) >) ; output '(1 2 3 4 5)
(sort (list 1 2 3 4 5) <) ; outputs '(5 4 3 2 1)
```

Parentheses galore. People usually make fun of parentheses in lisp languages, so in Racket, one can use brackets and curly braces in place of parentheses for readability.

```racket
(+ 1 1 [+ 2 2] 3 3 {* 2 2}) ; output 16
```

defining variables with define

Variables are placeholders for a value

```racket
(define num 69) ; here we bind the value 69 to the indetifier num
; here we use it for a list
(define list1 (list 1 2 3 4 5))
; we can then call the length function to that variable
(length list1)
; this outputs 5

; here we bind several values in 1 line
(define-values (a b c) (values 1 2 3))
; a would be 1
; b would be 2
; c would be 3
```

defining functions with define

Functions are basically a series of operations. Functions produce a value. We can use the output of a function as input to another function. When we do that, it's called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_composition_(computer_science)">composition</a>

```racket
; defining functions with define
; follows the following format:

; (define (function-name parameter) 
;   expression 
;   expression
;	)

; here's an example with 2 parameters

(define (add-two-numbers x y)
  (+ x y))

; we call the function like this

(add-two-numbers 4 5) 
; above outputs 9

; another example, just 1 parameter

(define (square-number x)
  (* x x))

(square-number 10) ; output 100

; here we use values from 2 functions we defined

(add-two-numbers (+ 5 5)
                 (- (square-number 5)
                                (+ 3 (add-two-numbers 10 20))))

; above outputs 2


```

set! keyword

while <code>define</code> is used to define a location to store value, <code>set!</code> is for placing a new value to a defined location. 

```racket
(define num 69)
; we bind value 69 to the identifier num
(set! num 420)
; here we assign 420 to variable num, this mutates the old value 69 to 420
(define num 42069)
; nonetheless we can still do the above, of which variable num now holds 42069
```

conditionals

we can make conditional expressions with <code>cond</code>

```racket

; conditions follow the following format:
;
;(cond [condition1 result1]
;      [condition2 result2]
;      [condition3 result3])

; here's an example

(cond
  [(> 3 5) "wont print as the condition returns false"]
  [(= 2 4) "wont print as the condition returns false"]
  [(<= 1 3) "this will print"])
  
; outputs "this will print"


```

Pretty simple.
