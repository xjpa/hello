<h2>Description</h2>
<p align="justify">A game created during college as one of my projects for my 2nd programming course, which was about data structures and OOP, the other project in that course being a car game. Unfortunately I don't have a copy of that car game's code anymore, even <mark>this pen island code is not the full/final version</mark>. The game is pretty simple, just a 2d game inspired by flappy bird, this time you are dodging pens moving towards your direction. Number near the bottom is the player's score.</p>
