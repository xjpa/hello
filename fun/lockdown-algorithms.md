<h2>Description</h2>
<p align="justify">A project of mine to develop my computational thinking. For this one, I am focusing on the algorithmic side of computational thinking, and had thus started going through algorithmic programming problems to sharpen it. I mostly did my work in Java, C++, Python, and JavaScript. I found it to be a great way to learn some built in libraries in a programming language, specifically those for sorting and parsing.</p>

<p align="justify">If you go through my code, you'd notice that plenty of them have comments detailing what is happening, my thinking at the time, and things I've learned from doing the problem. Some even have comments for every line of code like the screenshot from the thumbnail. It is ugly to look at but those are purely for my learning benefit</p>

<h2>Tech Stack</h2>
<p>C++, JavaScript, Python, Java</p>

<h2>Background</h2>

I got quarantined a few times since this COVID-19 pandemic began. The first time I was quarantined, I was sent to this room

With slow and unreliable internet in that room, I decided it's best to just spend the time randomly learning java and algorithms because all it took was a PDF or some small sized ebook file of an algorithms textbook I could easily download online even if the net is unreliable, very much unlike if I spent the time doing webdevelopment instead, the downloading of node or whatever dependencies or software/IDEs would've given me a bad time with the internet. Anyhow since then, I continued pushing my solutions & notes to whatever problems I solve into this repo
