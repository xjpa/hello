<h2>Description</h2>
<p align="justify">This repo contains my solutions for classic computer science books that I'm going through, namely <a href="https://htdp.org/">How to Design Programs (HtDP)</a>, <a href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/sites/default/files/sicp/full-text/book/book.html">Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs</a> (SICP aka "the wizard book"), and K&R's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_C_Programming_Language">The C Programming Language</a> (or TCPL) </p>

<p align="justify">I started HTDP after getting inspired from a <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/PinoyProgrammer/comments/kkghxi/please_help_me_decide_where_to_start/ghcpi0l/">reddit thread</a> (here's an <a href="https://archive.is/VqiyS">archived link</a>) where OP asks for some advice on how they could get started with programming and one dude replied to do HtDP. After some searching and reading the website and the other courses from its authors, I decided to stick with it and so far I have learned a lot.</p>

<p align="justify">As for doing SICP, it's merely because Hacker News tends to recommend it a lot, as well as old school hackers generally view it in high regard, and see it as somewhat a rite of passage to becoming a full fledge hacker. Some examples of those who praised it include John Carmack, Robert "Bob" Martin, George Hotz, and Peter Norvig. It's not my focus at the moment although it does give me a nice break from the "grind" nature of the boring HtDP text and its more boring exercises.</p>

<p align="justify">For K&R's TCPL, I'm doing it for its exercises as well as for learning C. As well as I'm doing it because of this review from Amazon (<a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2GO0Q2LPQ8UHS/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0131103628">link</a>):</p>

> This book is a feisty little devil! I had heard of this book before diving in (it is a classic), but its size and table of contents lead me to believe I would breeze right through it. Wrong! Picking up the syntax wasn't too difficult and I have a fairly good handle on more advanced concepts like pointers already, but this book is absolutely packed with exercises and many of them are quite challenging!
>
> Here's one:
>
> "Write a program to check a C program for syntax errors like unbalanced parenthesis, brackets and braces. Don't forget about quotes, both single and double, escape sequences, and comments."
>
> This is a chapter 1 exercise! Chapter 1 is just a tutorial introduction chapter and this is one 1 of 24 exercises in this chapter! No wonder it takes people years to work through this tiny book. I'm only about halfway through as I write this review.
