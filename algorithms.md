title: Algorithmic Problems
---

<p align="justify">This page links to articles containing my solutions to algorithm problems in leetcode, kattis, uva, and spoj in Java with explanations. Note that some of them may not be the best solution, I'm just blogging mostly about what I did to get my first accepted solution. I didnt bother to go back on these problems later when i got better at algorthimic problem solving. </p>

<p align="justify">There are four reasons for this series. First is for me to do a quick review of some algorithmic problems when I need to. Second is that the act of writing each of these blog posts solidifies the concepts learned from each problems for me. The third is that I hope some people will find these notes of mine helpful, especially for the beginner - particularly I'm thinking about my siblings who just started learning how to program. Finally, because on <a href="/articles/2021/01/02/goals-2021">my blog post for my goals for the year of 2021</a>, I mentioned that I wanted to have a basic algorithmic problem solving ability.</p>
