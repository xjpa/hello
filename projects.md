<h2>Projects page</h2>

<p>The purpose of this page is to list the projects I worked on that benefitted me in getting better at programming. It's meant for me to track how much I improved and have done every year in terms of improving my software engineering and computer science skills. Clicking the links corresponding to the year will bring you to my project page for that year.</p>

<h2>Year</h2>
