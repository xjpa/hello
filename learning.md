<p align="justify">Part of my new year's resolution for 2022 is to have a way to track my productivity and I'll be doing this by creating a daily log that I call a learning journal of what i'm working on and learning every day, as well as it also includes when I took breaks to do nothing or simply relaxed to enjoy life.

<div>
  <p>what i'm learning</p>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="../learning/2022"><big><big>2022</big></big></a></li>
  </ul>
</div>
