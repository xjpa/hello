<u>2022-01-01 to 2022-01-08</u>

- <p>break. new year travels, bingewatching shows like <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt8421350/">Manifest</a> and the latest season of <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7221388/">Cobra Kai</a></p>

<u>2022-01-09</u>

- Getting back to programming. Spent most of the day reading though.

- <p>A friend recommended me a book called <a href="https://cpbook.net/">Competitive Programming 4</a> a few months ago. The book, he claims, gives a good foundation for algorithms and has a lot of exercises. I thought that such a very exercise/hands-on book would be great as classic algo books like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Introduction_to_Algorithms">CLRS</a> are so boring and mathy. I just got it recently and I spent the day reading it. Plenty grind kattis problems to get started with solving algorithmic problems

- <p>After looking at some of the problems in the book, I realised how much I suck at algorithms and math, and so signed up for a course called <a href="https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/courses/cp-maths-java">Mathematics for Competitive Programming in Java</a> to learn some basic maths, and <a href="https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/courses/fork-java">Fork Java Programming</a> to do some basic problems because doing basic problems gives me motivation lol. Both courses are exercise heavy, that's one thing I like about geeksforgeeks.</p>

- <p>Started learning swift. <a href="../articles/2022/01/07/goals-2022">One of my goals this year</a> is to learn mobile development and ship an app. On that same blog post, I said that I wont do iOS since I'm not working on a serious project anyway and that paying $100 yearly to publish one on Apple seems like a waste. But yesterday I finally updated my 2019 MBP from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacOS_Mojave">Mojave</a> to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacOS_Monterey">Monterey</a>, and I feel like playing with the new XCode. I came across a website called <a href="https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui">100 Days of Swift UI</a>, and thought it'd be an easy way to develop a good learning habit. So that's why I created a repo for it, and maybe learn more swift/iOS development from other resources. <u>I still won't publish to iOS though, I'm just learning it for fun.</u> I'll learn Android/Flutter later. </p>

<u>2022-01-10</u>

- <p>Algorithms grind and beginning reactJS</p>

- <p>Studied arrays and problems with them, then I solved various problems at at kattis where I did 10 problems. Then I went to leetcode and did a problem. Then I read more from the book Competitive Programming 4</p>

- <p>Stumbled across something called <a href="https://www.purereact.com/">pure react</a> by dave ceddia and started going through it. Didn't write any code though, just created a repo and still reading through the book</p>

- <p>I logged in recently to hackerrank, a website I haven't visited in a long while. I found that they've now got study plans for interviews, and there I chose their <a href="https://www.hackerrank.com/interview/preparation-kits/three-month-preparation-kit/three-month-week-one/challenges">3 month interview prep course</a> that has 104 exercises with 13 additional mock tests. I'll stick with this one for a while.</p>

<u>2022-01-11 and 2022-01-12</u>

- <p>break for 2 days</p>

<u>2022-01-13</u>

- <p>I came across this website <a href="https://techinterviewhandbook.org/best-practice-questions/">Tech Interview Handbook - Best Practice Questions</a>. The author created the famous <a href="https://www.teamblind.com/post/New-Year-Gift---Curated-List-of-Top-75-LeetCode-Questions-to-Save-Your-Time-OaM1orEU">Blind 75</a>, which some folks at reddit accussed of stealing from that same website (tech interview handbook) lol. The author once published a medium post about it too at freecodecamp I think, and said that he's the author of both the tech interview handbook website and the blind 75. Anyhow, the "Best Practice Questions" was a nice find for me, as I didnt know that the author has condensed the 75 questions down to 50 better curated ones.</p>

- <p>Swift/iOS App Development: kept learning swift, this day was about booleans, string interpolation, arrays, etc. </p>

<u>2022-01-14</u>

- <p>found this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1AluWkr4YY">hidden gem of a performance</a> by a late-90s band called Penfold around midnight and it made me feel nostalgic - especially near the ending where folks are jumping around and hugging each other. It reminded me of the high school and college farewell parties I went to where in the later hours of the evening, everyone is just screaming along the music in the room with emotion and doing cringy dance moves because you stopped caring about what looks cool at that point. The nostalgia also gives me this sadness, but the good kind of sadness: the "yearning-for-happy-days" kind of sad where you feel motivated to blast through and grind. <b><mark>Today's gonna be a productive day, I guarantee you that.</mark></b> It's passed midnight and time for me to sleep, get some rest and let's smash this day so I can have something good to write about tomorrow. LET'S GOOOO</p>

- <p>Now that the day has ended: I didnt do any programming today, although I did study some algorithms which according to my <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forest_(application)">forest app</a>, I spent 4 hours on it. Later in the evening I studied some fundamental maths. I looked at some udemy courses for math video resources and settled with <a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/mastering-amc-8/">Mastering AMC 8</a>, <a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/mathematics-bridging-course-high-school-to-university/">Maths Bridging Course - Algebra, Trigonometry and Calculus</a>, <a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/discrete-math/">Discrete Mathematics</a>, and <a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/linear-algebra-and-geometry-1/">Linear Algebra and Geometry 1</a>. I'm doing exercises from the AOPS' <a href="https://artofproblemsolving.com/alcumus">Alcumus</a> platform. </p>

<u>2022-01-15 to 2022-01-18</u>

- <p>Not sure what productive things I did in these 4 days, as I'm writing this in 2022-01-19. But I do remember that yesterday, I started studying some maths and did 100 problems. Most of the time though, I spent these days just watching movies, and TV shows like <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt8421350/">Manifest</a>. The bulk of my TV watching was spent on <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6342474/">Boruto: Naruto Next Generations</a>, a continuation of the anime <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naruto">Naruto</a>, I discovered Boruto just this week and it's bringing me massive Nostalgia.</p>

<u>2022-01-19</u>

- <p>Math studies, did 100 problems again today and studied some web development. I'll be focusing on <u>frontend development</u> for 2 weeks, because I suck at it. I'll be putting most of the stuff I'll be doing at the 50websites repo (link below), but I think that <mark>I'll be pushing the code there once a website is done or almost done. Thus for now, the repo is empty</mark> apart from the index page. And yes, I plan to have <mark>50 (static) websites there.</mark></p>

<u>2022-01-20</u>

- <p>Got a subscription to Frontend Masters and spent the day skimming through their courses, and doing some other stuff too. I created a repo to put some notes and code I make for the courses on Frontend Masters. I also picked up some jQuery today, and later used a bit of it to spice up this website's about page.</p>

<u>2022-01-21</u>

- <p>break</p>

<u>2022-01-22</u>

- <p>thought of making a new project, and spent the time studying some tech for it</p>

- <p>github: <a href="https://github.com/johnamata/mejium">mejium</a></p>

<u>2022-01-23</u>

- <p>break</p>

<u>2022-01-24</u>

- started working on the project from the other day, but spent more of my time learning about the tech for it

- <p>github: <a href="https://github.com/johnamata/mejium">mejium</a></p>

<u>2022-01-25</u>

- <p>I started planning a new project for java project. Anyhow, I cracked open a new book called <a href="https://computationbook.com/">Understanding Computation</a> and it looks like this is going to be good</p>

<u>2022-01-26</u>

- <p>just nothing much, studied some javascript and revamped my website, learning CSS during the process and jQuery. Anyhow, I looked into my mejium project a bit but didnt commit my biggest changes yet</p>

- <p>github: <a href="https://github.com/johnamata/mejium">mejium</a></p>

<u>2022-01-27</u>

- <p>break</p>

<u>2022-01-28</u>

- <p>I noticed that my learning entries have been slacking lately. All small changes, and smaller text entries about what i did that day. To be honest, I'm only just now writing my daily learning entries for the past week, and it turns out that it's hard to recall them. As well as not writing daily entries makes me way less productive. It's 18:20 today and I still haven't done much, except a workout and grinding 110 math problems, at least that's what my math app on my phone says. Let's be productive today. Let's start this habit of writing a ton of stuff daily</p>

- <p>In the end, I did write a lot lol, but it's just all about politics. I just spent the time watching the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLmL1jxjjsrjrjKjtEyqcLFyLYo2-FFv_V">2022 Philippine Presidential Interviews with Boy Abunda</a>. The Philippine Presidential Election is coming and is only months away (May 9, 2022). I know that politics are for losers but I finally registered as a voter. It's just for bucket list purposes, this'll be the first and likely last election I will participate in. You can read the notes I made for each presidentiable from the interviews here: <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/156b0LZGClLpTXsYUHt9ScvRpDrPNTCDnUfyYoliUDeU/edit?usp=sharing">link to google docs</a></p>

<u>2022-01-29</u>

- <p>break. Dissapointed with myself as I planned to be productive this day, but instead I didnt do anything. I just didnt plan my day.</p>

<u>2022-01-30</u>

- <p>mostly a break. Today was supposed to be a trip with the family to go out biking in the countryside, but I woke up late and tired from last night that I told them I won't be coming</p>

- <p>I did looked into planning some new projects, doing some foreign language learning (German and Spanish), and when the day was about to end, I went back to work on my project called <a href="https://github.com/johnamata/mejium">mejium</a>, but I never made any new commits to the repository for this day</p>

<u>2022-01-31</u>

- <p>Nothing much done except a decision to learn distributed app architectures, and that led me to making a new project (which I'll continue later, like next month?) using a MERN stack (Mongo, Express, React, Node), it's going to be an ecommerce site.</p>

<u>2022-02-01</u>

- <p>A pretty lazy day, all I did was started looking into redis and decided that it'd be a great thing to build a project about it where I learn to implement redis from scratch. I chose the ruby programming language to do it, so that I could learn some ruby too. I aim to continue this one later, tomorrow and the next few days I plan to focus on improving my fundamentals for node, react, frontend development, javascript, and algorithms in javascript. That is my focus for February</p>
