## How to Design Programs, 2nd Edition

<a href="https://htdp.org/"><img src="/photos/books/htdp2.jpg" height ="300"></a>

This book is being recommended over other classics like Robert Martin's [Clean Code](https://www.amazon.com/Clean-Code-Handbook-Software-Craftsmanship/dp/0132350882) as a better way to learn "systematic program design." That... and because <a href="https://hn.algolia.com/?q=%22how+to+design+programs%22">all the shills at Hacker News</a> are writing about how it's the best book to build computational thinking, is what got me to go through it.
