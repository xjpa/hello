## Notes

Too lazy to type it here, so here are 3 images of some scanned pages of the book:

These scanned images are basically the guiding principles of capital allocation, which the book explores well.

Even though I'm a guy who works on software, capital allocation is a great subject to learn as it provides a unique big picture view, especially that for a crucial aspect of business strategy that many developers and hackers lack. Why do layoffs happen that way? How to think about PIP? How to think about earnings? What projects should we focus on? How do we measure efficiency? How do unprofitable "moonshot" companies/startups like Uber survive and what's their gameplan?
