## The Mythical Man Month - notes

## Chapter 1 - The Tar Pit

- What makes programming fun? Joy of making things, making things that are useful for others, joy of always learning, seeing multiple components work together, and finally working on a medium that provides an extensive amount of freedom. It gratifies "creative longings deep within us."

- Author then talks about how programming is a "tar pit" after listing some of the woes of programming (being dependent on others/other software, you rarely control your work/objectives, etc.). And that this book provides "boardwalks to walk across the tar."

## Chapter 2 - The Mythical Man Month

- <p>5 reasons why software projects fail due to lack of time:</p>

> First, our techniques of estimating are poorly developed. More seriously, they reflect an unvoiced <mark>assumption which is quite un- true, i.e., that all will go well</mark>.
>
> Second, our estimating techniques fallaciously confuse effort with progress, hiding the <mark>assumption that men and months are interchangeable.</mark>
>
> Third, because we are <mark>uncertain of our estimates</mark>, software managers often lack the courteous stubbornness of Antoine's chef.
>
> Fourth, <mark>schedule progress is poorly monitored</mark>. Techniques proven and routine in other engineering disciplines are considered radical innovations in software engineering.
>
> Fifth, when schedule slippage is recognized, the natural (and traditional) <mark>response is to add manpower</mark>. Like dousing a fire with gasoline, this makes matters worse, much worse. More fire re- quires more gasoline, and thus begins a regenerative cycle which ends in disaster.

- Author mentions Dorothy Sayer's book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Mind-Maker-Dorothy-L-Sayers/dp/1520215185">The Mind of the Maker</a>, where creative activity has 3 stages: idea, implementation, interaction

- Thought mode on why we have bugs: the medium in programming is tractable, so we tend to have an optimistic assumption that there'll be fewer difficulties in implementation

- <p>Man month:</p>

> Men and months are interchangeable commodities only when a task can be partitioned among many workers with no communication among them...
>
> The bearing of a child takes nine months, no matter how many women are assigned. Many software tasks have this characteristic because of the <mark>sequential nature of debugging</mark>.
>
> In tasks that can be partitioned but which require communication among the subtasks, the <mark>effort of communication must be added to the amount of work</mark> to be done.

- Added burden of communication: training and intercommunication. Training men can not be partitioned.

- Intercommunication is worse, if each task must be separately coordinated with others, effort increases by n(n-1)/2: For example 4 workers require 6x intercoms as 2 workers. 3 workers require 3x as much as 2 workers.

- Software dev is a systems effort meaning an exercise in complex relationships, thus good communication is beneficial. Adding more men lengthens the schedule.

- Testing is the most mischeduled part in software dev because we are optimistic.
