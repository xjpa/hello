## 4 Hour Workweek

- At its core the book is about lifestyle design to become what Tim refers to as the *New Rich*, a group of people who maximise for freedom and mobility. Tech made plenty of the advice in this book obsolete, but nonetheless, the idea of planning one's path towards Tim's "New Rich" lifestyle is what I feel makes this book worth it

- You dont have to quit your job or retire early

- What's the worst that could happen? Experiments outside the norm often cost nothing, especially in a world where everyone is failing. You can turn off all the noise and the world wouldnt end. 

> Flash forward to 2011; is a job interviewer asking about that unusual gap year?
>
> “Everyone was getting laid off and I had a once-in-a-lifetime chance to travel around the world. It was incredible.”

- <mark>People dont want to be a millionaire, they want the experience they think being a millionaire has.</mark> Oftentimes, you dont need that much money at all.

- Tim has these 3 questions for an entrepreneurship lecture he gave at Princeton

>How do your decisions change if retirement isn’t an option?
>
> What if you could use a mini-retirement to sample your deferred-life plan reward before working 40 years for it?
>
> Is it really necessary to work like a slave to live like a millionaire?”

- <p>4 step process for reinventing one's lifestyle</p> 

1. D for Definition: planning the lifestyle you want

2. E for Elimination: boosting productivity and time management

3. A for Automation: finding income and automating your tasks

4. L for Liberation: mini-retirements, remote work

- Note that DEAL is entrerpreneurially minded, but employees can implement them in the DELA order

- Always ask yourself: What is one thing that if you do, will change everything?

- The lifestyle proposed in the book seems to be well applicable for people who want to keep working/being a wagie. Basically you have these things called recovery periods and mini-retirements to explore things you like. Nonetheless, you can also still apply this to entrepreneurs, like Bill Gates has his think weeks. 

- Steady cashflow > large payday

- For a woman's mini-retirement, she took her family for a 15-month world sailing trip. Sailed 15,000 miles from Venice to Polynesia and it cost only $18000 to $19000. 

> Most people would consider this impossible. Then again, most people don’t know that more than 300 families set sail from France each year to do the same.

- Question to ask yourself: What if I did the opposite?

- Cold calling executives from 08:00-08:30 and 18:00-18:30 to avoid secretaries

- <mark>Retirement is the worst case, as it is based on the assumption that you dislike what you do</mark>. I like this one, it reminded me of a book I skimmed called Black Hole Focus, of which I'll be putting for my reading list this year after I type this. Black Hole Focus talked that it's better to have a job or something to do when you're older, as among other things, it increases your longevity as seen on the Japanese

- mini-retirements distributed through your life > retirement

- Timing is never right. Just do it and adapt, fix things along the way

- It is more lucrative to leverage your strengths than to fix your weaknesses which mostly just upgrades you to mediocre.
