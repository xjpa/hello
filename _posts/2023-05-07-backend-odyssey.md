This begins a massive blog post series I'll be writing about backend engineering

<!-- more -->

I decided to learn backend engineering in-depth, part of my upskilling journey to be a good Machine Learning Engineer (MLE). Throughout this learning journey I will be making a series of posts to reflect what I've learned, sort of like the <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=18787654">Richard Feynman method of learning</a>. I'll also make notes of my learnings, notes that I'll continuously update through time and blog as well. This blog post in particular, will serve as a compendium of these learnings, to provide a bird's eye view, or an itinerary to this backend engineering learning odyssey I'm taking.

I'll be continuously updating this post to link and arrange my notes and blog posts on backend engineering in an order that would serve helpful hopefully to a beginner. My only target audience for this is myself, as well as my younger sibling who's still young in his teens and had just recently began his journey in programming. Although at the moment he's going to flight school to be a pilot. Thank Top Gun Maverick for that. But that seems like a better life for him, a time honoured craftsman job like a pilot for your career, while having an option to do programming as one of your creative outlets or gigs.
