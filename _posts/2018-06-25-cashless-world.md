I went to Beijing. I stayed for a month, and saw some sights like the Great Wall, Summer Palace, and others, then did other things like going around the streets and haggling at Silk Street ;) Throughout all of these, I think that what astounded me the most was how “cashless” Beijing is.

One realises this when one starts to run out of cash. Exchanging your dollars to yuan takes could take about an hour due to the slow system at exchanges. VISA only works in only a few places as well, such as Starbucks.

Soon, I found out that WeChat is the preferred mode of payment there. You can pay nearly everything with WeChat. You pay the bus & trains with WeChat, hotels & apartments, fast foods and even humble fruit stands accept em. Heck, even those free public wifi requires a WeChat login. And get this: even the street buskers and the homeless accept money through WeChat - they have this printed QR code for you to scan with your phone. It made me wonder, how did China adapt to this “mobile economy” and why aren’t other countries following suit?

Countries like Zimbabwe seem to have created a mobile economy as well. But to them, it’s pretty much a necessity for their hyperinflated economy. It’s why countries facing major inflation like them (eg. Venezuela) are the first major adopters of mobile payments and stuff like bitcoin/cryptocurrency, as the majority of the country don’t have access to banks. But that’s not the deal here with China. It is such a contrast to the US where it still seems to favour things like VISA/Mastercard and Apple/Android Pay.

Other developed western countries seem to do the same like in urban Australia it is pretty much a common thing to go cashless nowadays - only bringing out your credit card since it’s so easy with Visa PayWave. But for most of the Western world, credit cards are enough. Especially since they’ve begun improving their credit cards with a “contactless” capability. Just tap and you’re good to go. Transactions happen in less than a second, no need for signatures or entering your pin.

Though I guess it may not be a socioeconomic thing, perhaps it’s more cultural. It seems to me that Asians have a disdain for using credit cards, thinking of loans and debt as bad while the western way of thinking contrasts this mindset: “It’s not debt unless you pay it early”. Sometimes it’s even seen as free money with all those reward points. 

Or maybe we could look at it from a tech perspective.

The advent of the iPhone and about 2 years later, the android, created the smartphone revolution. Android, mass production, and Chinese fakes then made smartphones cheaply available for pretty much everyone. As a result, most countries who are still in their "developing stage" had instantly jumped onto the digital tech revolution by way of skipping the laptop/desktop stage that other first world, particularly western countries, had. When you have a culture used to computational processes on their phones, as compared to a culture who grew up used to those things on a computer at home or at work, it's easier for them to adopt and trust a type of economy or payment that favours mobility.
