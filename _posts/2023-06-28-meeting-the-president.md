A bunch of pictures taken from a trip to the Philippines' cradle of power.

Inside the gates of the Malacanang Palace. I'm not sure what the building is on the back of the fountain, but behind the camera's view, (I didnt take a pic of it as didnt want to include the Palace guard's faces) is the entrance to the main building of the Malacanang.

Upon entering the main building and coming up the grand staircase, you are welcomed to the mythical painting by Juan Luna, our national artist.

Named <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Blood_Compact">El Pacto de Sangre</a> aka "The Blood Compact." It's one of his last paintings and has been away from public viewing since it was moved to the palace. It's actually quite larger than what the above picture depicts. For scale, see pic below with me next to it

Gotta take photos with the presidential portraits. Here's me with 2 of the greatest, at least according to the public: it's either Rodrigo Duterte (L) for the conservatives or NoyNoy Aquino (R) for the liberals

Also took photos with the other presidential portraits as well, such as here's with the most controversial of them all Ferdinand Marcos (L), the father of our current president. On his right is Diosdado Macapagal. Speaking of Ferdinand Marcos, his son BBM seems to be closely following him. Both have western views on politics, especially BBM as his policies tend to closely follow whatever's trending in the west from his views on foreign policies to LGBT to COVID-19. Compared to his political rival Leni Robredo, to western eyes, BBM makes Leni (liberal party) look like a conservative.

A nice lunch by the river. They served buffet. Shrimp, pastries, pasta, chicken, fruits, and more. You could see the top of the Malacanang boat by the balcony

Waiting for the president to speak at the Rizal Hall, it's looked so much better now especially if you compared photos of it to those a decade ago. Earlier this year, the President has made significant [renovations to the Palace](https://news-k.abs-cbn.com/video/spotlight/02/06/23/marcos-family-makes-renovations-to-malacaang-palace). The the tall one in white barong surrounded by black suits in front of the podium is the Secretary of Defense

Minutes later and on schedule, the King. His excellency.

Perhaps I'm used to presidents like Obama and Biden. Which has made me surprised to see that his excellency was able to give a lengthy eloquent speech without reading from a teleprompter or some similar device. He never looked down to read from a paper, or had devices he could read from in the podium. He really prepared for this. And it is very likely that he also has to attend and give multiple public speeches a week. Imagine the mental load it must take to prepare for such occasions, while juggling his other responsibilities as head of state. His father was known to also be a brilliant orator who also memorized all his speeches, whether that be long or short. Such as here's [a short speech of his father I remember](https://youtu.be/t8AxvM1JVDM).

Anyways, the following's another photo of the President. After he met with each one of us, he had a final photo with the other top officials. He's the one wearing a barong at the 1st row, below the president's seal with his hands reaching for his pockets, next to his defense secretary, the honourable [Gilbert Teodoro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gilbert_Teodoro), the smartest president this country never had

These are just some of the photos I took, I have taken about 200+ photos and a few videos. But some of those I feel are not for public viewing. At least I havent seen anyone sharing photos and videos of themselves walking around the Malacanang grounds, rooms, or travelling by the Malacanang cart (it's like a golf cart they drive you through the palace), so I guess I'll keep those for myself. Although the Palace guards never told me to not take photos and videos, and had no problems when I took snapshots of the Palace.

One thing explicitly not allowed though is taking a selfie with his excellency and to refrain from using flash. The palace security briefs you on this prior to your visit to the Malacanang

Luckily, they did have photographers at the Malacanang to take a photo of you and the President.

<u>Just one photo of you and your family with the president is taken</u>. And it's done so fast, that I just didnt bother posing for a smile. Not really a problem for me. I read sometime ago that various studies said us men look better when we're not smiling anyway lol. Based on my experience especially with dating apps, that seems to be the case. But then again, some demographics might view things differently, French/Spanish girls I dated prefer me having facial hair, while Filipinas I dated told me to shave it down `¯\_(ツ)_/¯`

A day later the Malacanang Palace gave a large printed copy of the photo (about 40 inches) with an elegant picture frame. Perhaps later once I get a digital copy of it then I'll update this post to attach that photo here. Or I may not as I'll have to find a way to scan that big photo

Anyways, til next time. I have to prepare for a flight in a few hours
