A review of what happened during my 8 month internship at willis towers watson. I'm still not finished with the internship (ending this month) but I feel that I should write this now.

# Learning software engineering

- I got to learn C#, ASP.NET, WPF, Azure, and Angular 1 & 2. That's my stack for most of this internship

- I got to write code to production, and almost all projects I worked on were used globally

- I got to experience finding and debugging a race condition on a financial app used globally (albeit internally by willis towers watson employees)

- I got to learn how software engineers debug, though this was mostly because I shadowed senior software engineers during my onboarding week, sitting next to them and watching them work on their projects (that must've been nerve wracking to them!). They gave me some tips as they work on their projects

- My first week during onboarding was helping business analysts with excel work and VB.NET

- They schedule training for you as well as provide learning resources. One training was a several day VB.NET training bootcamp though I never attended it, I just learned enough VB.NET in a day to be productive enough and I never needed VB.NET anyway for most of my internship

- Experienced mostly working on web development and desktop app development along the way

- I got to experience agile development and planning. Interns are always in meetings

- Senior Software Engineers and Software Architects mentored me throughout the internship on architecture, design patterns (though admittably I did not listen much for this one as I didnt see the importance at the time), ASP.NET, and Angular

- They welcomed initiative projects from interns, mine was a financial reports management tool for Philippine Banks

- Another initiative project was a a mini-search engine from scratch. The idea was to create a comprehensive retrieval system for business teams from EU and Canada to sift through EU and Asia data.

- In July, most of my work was on frontend. That's when I learned that frontend development is not for me. LOL one of the projects was working with building a google sheets/MS Excel webapp and having had no experience with frontend frameworks and Angular before, that was complete hell

- I got to write documentations for User Acceptance Testing

- Learned to write more complex SQL scripts beyond what is taught in school

- Learned the importance of dynamic programming in the real world, testing multiple edit distance algorithms to satisfy a spec for a search function. In the end, implemented a custom levenshtein distance. Later realized fancy algorithms are not worth it, when my senior just showed me a simpler solution. LOL

- I got to develop and then release a management system into production that scaled from 1 QPS to 23 QPS (or almost 2 million per day)

- I got to develop pattern matching tools for compiling and merging reports

- I got to debug issues and push into production multiple features across 3 financial web apps

# Does WTW Philippines pass the joel test?

About the joel test: <a href="https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2000/08/09/the-joel-test-12-steps-to-better-code/">link</a>

<p>1. Do you use source control?</p>
Yes, Team Foundation Server is used though I heard that some teams are on Git.
<p>2. Can you make a build in one step?</p>
Everything I worked on can be built in one step.
<p>3. Do you make daily builds?</p>
There is continuous integration.
<p>4. Do you have a bug database?</p>
Yes, we have an internal software for that.
<p>5. Do you fix bugs before writing new code?</p>
Not always, some are delayed in favour of a feature addition or enhancement.
<p>6. Do you have an up-to-date schedule?</p>
Yes, the team meets up with the scrum master in N. America via conference call 1-2x a week. Typical agile process, daily standups, retropsectives, etc. All features and plans were smashed when I was there.
<p>7. Do you have a spec?</p>
Business analysts plan out the specs, they also test the UI and functionalities even though we have a dedicated QA for that.
<p>8. Do programmers have quiet working conditions?</p>
Usually yes. The workplace is using an open office floor plan though so sometimes (actually, rarely), it can be a bit noisy. One thing I liked was about in every 15:00 (3 pm) a team nearby does office yoga and we can hear and watch them do it.
<p>9. Do you use the best tools money can buy?</p>
Yes, pretty easy to request for better computers and even learning resources such as pluralsight. Developers are given dual monitors, though I never found a need for the other. You can also request to be given a laptop to work remotely.
<p>10. Do you have testers?</p>
Every team has dedicated testers, all business analysts also check in to see if things are going well accordingly to the requirements. Business analyst interns also act as QA testers and I believe automate their tests with selenium I think
<p>11. Do new candidates write code during their interview?</p>
Yes, typically hackerrank style algorithmic questions that range from writing parts of an interpreter (like a lexical parser) to printing a certain pattern into the console.
<p>12. Do you do hallway usability testing?</p>
UI changes are reviewed by almost everyone.

# Some goodies I liked

- The office (W City Center) is pretty close to our home, a 15 minute drive. People commuting though would have a problem, as only taxis pass through the nearby roads.

- Very friendly to interns. We had one intern who doesnt know OOP, had just finished I think freshman year, but was smart (dean's lister) and disciplined. While it's friendly to interns, the interview process at WTW though can be a hit or miss, in our org one of the problems is live coding a parser.

- Went to several all expenses-paid "team building" events like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escape_room">escape rooms</a> to overnight stays at a resort, went to the cinema to watch movies, etc. Granted, the budget is based on the org. Our org just happens to be a good profit center

- <p>No definite time schedule. You can come in anytime you like as long as you finish 8 hours of work every day. This doesnt include lunch break, so I usually end up staying on average of 9 hours. Sometimes I get to finish tasks early, and thus leave early. You could see this for example in one of my attendance sheets seen below. Usually I get to 10 hours/day because of a long meeting. By the way the time is tracked by one of the software I was developing during my internship, and released to be used in the company</p>

- Most dont care at all if you lax throughout the day as long as you deliver requirements. Once I finish all tasks for a sprint (lasts 2 weeks), I can just spend the rest of the week going around places at BGC

- There's budget for engineers to attend conferences

- We have a town hall meeting every month

- Had a nice weekend summer break on the beaches with the whole team, was full of booze, boating, laughs, games, and several buffets from the resort

- Occasional free lunches and pizzas, and treats at the end of a sprint

- Beautiful office, high end, and high security. Needs an ID that needs to be scanned at multiple sections like rooms and even the cafeteria for the door to be opened. At ground floor there's multiple guards and still requires an ID to enter and use elevators. It just felt cool to me to swipe my IDs to get in

- Office location is also overlooking prime BGC skyline (I was at the W City Center office, they have another office in BGC), park for jogging is right next door, nice cafes and restaurants below, BGC highstreet is just a 5 minute walk away -- I like to go there every 2PM for a walk/de-stress and look at shops and pretty girls.

- At night, it gets fun. There is a high end club at W City Center and there's loads of hot chicks (though older than me, must be at their late 20s) coming up the elevator every time I sign off. I got one chick's number, maybe if I had been more ballsy I'd gotten a new one every day

- Anyone can reserve rooms for a meeting or just some banter. Yes, even us interns. I remember we reserved a large conference room just to talk about our initiative projects. We then spent the rest of the hour play games on our mobile phones, and talked about which clubs at BGC to hit next. I remember just feeling a sense of aweness during that moment, like we've discovered some new superpower. Last time I felt that way was my first day in college where I went out for a lunch break with my friends and they were like "hey man let's go eat some lunch at the end of town" and thinking that newfound adult freedom was pretty cool

- Nice internship pay, though I used all my money here (yes, from May-December 2017) to buy cryptocurrencies. I remember my first paycheck: went to the bank and 2 days later, withdrawed it and immediately went to 7-Eleven with cash in hand to load my cryptowallet using one of their payment services, buying bitcoin at around $1k

- Interns can request to work at home and get a work laptop. Some dev interns took advantage of it and worked from home. I personally liked going to the office though as I also got allowance for it, which I of course spent all of it on crypto. Bitcoin and Ethereum to the moooon -- we holding for decade boyos

- All employees were tech geeks, even the ones who dont have a tech job. I remember folks being interested in the latest frameworks and happenings in tech, but not in the uber geek kind of way

- Company has a smooth handling of internship. For example my school has a lot of requirements from our internship, such as having a "<u>Monthly Accomplishment Report</u>" (example for one month seen below) that we have to write and validate with our project manager or in my case, oftentimes the techlead of my team as the manager is always busy. Then we have a load of documents as well to submit that I forgot about. Massive thanks to the company's HR and management for making everything easy

<img src="/photos/wtw-intern-july.png">

- Employees in my team treat each other like family, and not the cringe/toxic kind of "family culture" that people are mocking these days at social media and especially tech forums like <a href="https://reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions">reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions</a>, but that subreddit is already toxic to begin with

- One of the members of our team likes to sell his wife's bakeries to us every lunch, was pretty comfy every lunch (we often eat out together) because of it

- Christmas party full of huge burgers and booze at a high end private bar

# Giving my thanks

Thanking the members of the teams I worked on:

- <p><strong>Mark:</strong> for forcing me to face my SQL/Database “phobia”. And for also making me realise that although I do not like working with .NET, there are still some gems worth mining - and this goes for everything that we do in life.</p>

- <p><strong>Mike:</strong> for all those talks about programming and investing. Those talks about jQuery and Angular, and advice on how to improve oneself.</p>

- <p><strong>Leo:</strong> from all those talks and meetings on business analytics, he gave me a mental framework on facing problems. </p>

- <p><strong>Abdel:</strong> for teaching me about deadpan humor lol, and about JavaScript debugging.</p>

- <p><strong>Matt:</strong> for exposing me to Design Patterns and for teaching me to not shy away from asking questions. Because you should always be humble as you can't know everything, and at the same time you must also be confident, because you can know anything you need.</p>

- <p><strong>Kels:</strong> for showing me how to make a documentation and how to turn over a project.</p>

- <p><strong>Rommel:</strong> for making me appreciate corporate work. You sir, just have this habit of making tasks worth enjoyable, and making it seem like every task has a definite purpose</p>

- <p><strong>Sean:</strong> for those talks on tech and career. Though that day may have eclipsed your memory, you talk a lot about what it's like in the industry as a senior developer</p>

- <p><strong>Emil:</strong> for those 1:1 talks about a career development on the tech industry, and project management.</p>

- <p><strong>Roland:</strong> for insights on the industry. Aside from the jokes that you crack up in the middle of the day, I will miss the talks about job hunting, your past experiences with other project managers, and your opinion on what defines a good leader.</p>

- <p><strong>Darwin:</strong> for giving me solid tips for the job hunt and talks about DevOps. </p>

- <p><strong>Jeania:</strong> for helping me cultivate the habit of looking for problems to solve.</p>

- <p><strong>Lui:</strong> for teaching me that the best way to vibe with a person, is through self-disclosure.

- <p><strong>April:</strong> for showing me how to arrange team events.</p>

- <p><strong>Amy and Analyn:</strong> for showing me what enterprise management looks like.</p>

- <p><strong>Daiz:</strong> for showing me a good example of solid project management and through my observation of how she worked, gave me a few business ideas.</p>

<p>And of course, there are more people in the team who I had the pleasure of working with, and to these people, I say my warmest thanks. Thank you for making my time at Willis Towers Watson memorable.</p>

<p align="justify">During my first week at Willis Towers Watson, they sent me to attend meetings on every team and every project that they have. They asked me to look at problems. And all those tasks given to me, the aggregate sum of it all, to these I give my greatest thanks. For ever since that week, I looked at problems differently.</p>

<p align="justify">Thank you for that. To quote Newton: If I have seen further, it is by standing on the shoulders of these giants.</p>

<p align="justify"></p>
<p align="justify">It's been great fun to intern at Willis Towers Watson, they really treat their workers well. Aside from acquiring tools and pieces of knowledge that I would use to further my career, I had a blast with the team.</p>

P.S. I wrote like a big 150 line T-SQL stored procedure as a quick hack, I feel sorry for the dude (hopefully not an intern) who has to go through refactoring that

# Adios

# More pictures...

These were taken I think in the span of just 3 days. I shouldve started that habit of taking more photos earlier. So many great memories, lost. But as Dr Seuss said: "don't cry because it's over, smile because it happened."
