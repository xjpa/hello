After scoring 96% for the IBM DB Cert exam last semester, I set my sights on Microsoft, specifically their entry level DB cert: Microsoft Technology Associate: Database Fundamentals (98-364)

<!-- more -->

It was way harder than IBM's, and was full of other concepts I was not prepared for (such as scalability and security), and especially things that were only relevant to Microsoft's (T-SQL syntax, SQL Server)

Fortunately, I managed to pass it. Pluralsight has a course on prepping for it:

[https://www.pluralsight.com/courses/database-admin-fundamentals](https://www.pluralsight.com/courses/database-admin-fundamentals).

I used the visual studio package (offers free pluralsight for a few months) to watch it. But I believe that course wasn't enough. I managed to pass because the database concepts from the IBM specifically

- syntax

- normalization

- recovery

and more were still a bit fresh in my head. I scored 86% for Microsoft's, not bad I guess for a weekend of studying for it.

As a student, I would recommend taking it because a number of the questions are practical and ask you both situational problems and questions that has you weighing the business value, things that I believe are important to succeed in a job, especially as you go beyond senior -- at least that's based on advice I read from [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/) and blogs like [mini-microsoft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mini-Microsoft).
